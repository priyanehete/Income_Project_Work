### üìùDescription

The project objective is to leverage the available features to construct a predictive model capable of discerning whether an individual's income surpasses a predefined threshold, specifically exceeding 50K.

The aim is to understand the key factors that contribute to higher incomes.

The model can provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and individuals seeking to comprehend the determinants of financial success across diverse geographic and demographic contexts.
